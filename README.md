Yo, I'm Ghosty. I'm an amateur programmer. Made Lithium Backend Accessories.

**planned backend Accessories**:
- full AI-powered item shop generator (almost complete)
- Tournament Creator (for competitive tab, can be used for events)
- Battle pass customizer
- Custom Cosmetic ID creator (will require having the pre-existing assets)
- Live Event Creator (this is more game server than backend but will help with hosting)
- Maybe more if I ever finish all of these

tutorials should be on the GitHub page if it's finished. I'll probably fork lawinv2 or momentum at some point and add all of the backend accessories if you're too lazy to modify it yourself.
