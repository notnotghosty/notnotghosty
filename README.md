Yo, I'm Ghosty. I'm an amateur programmer. Made Lithium Backend Accessories.

**planned backend Accessories**:
- full AI-powered item shop generator (ts has been almost complete for like 3 days now idk why it is taking so long to get the export working)
- Tournament Creator (for competitive tab, can be used for events)
- Battle pass customizer
- simpler playlist manager for momentum backend
- Custom Cosmetic ID creator (will require having the pre-existing assets, also I have no idea how to do this so this will take a minute.)
- Live Event Creator (this is more game server than backend but will help with hosting, again I have no idea how to do this so don't expect this soon)
- Maybe more if I ever finish all of these

tutorials should be on the GitHub page if it's finished. I'll probably fork lawinv2 or momentum at some point and add all of the backend accessories if you're too lazy to modify it yourself.
